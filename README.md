##About Dataset
This study explores healthcare call data from April 2016 to February 2025 to understand patterns in healthcare service utilization during periods of emergency. Specifically, it examines the fluctuations in the total number of calls, including doctor consultations, health information requests, ambulance services, complaints, and inquiries about services. This analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of emergency response systems, focusing on how healthcare systems manage surges in demand during high-stress periods. By investigating spikes in call volumes, particularly during emergency periods, the study provides insights into the healthcare system's ability to manage such crises and the areas that require improvement.
